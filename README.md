## Research Objectives

My research aims to understand how contextual instability affects population movement inSwitzerland, particularly through longitudinal studies that track individuals or groups over an extended period.

## Information Technology Skills

### Areas
- **Data Science**: I am passionate about the quantitative analysis of large data sets to identify trends, make predictions, and aid in decision-making.
- **Data Visualization**: Effective data visualization is essential for making information accessible and understandable. I like spending a ton of time on data cleaning (but also in visualization).

### Programming Languages
- R
- Python
- Julia
- Nim

## Coding Interests

- **Data Analysis**: I enjoy deriving insights from complex data sets and do a ton of cleaning.
- **Data Visualization**: Let's make the data beautiful!
- **Simulation**: Creating models to predict future trends or test various hypotheses and strategies.
- **Web Scraping**: Efficiently extracting data from websites to enrich my analyses or feed my models with data.

I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects that explore these areas, or any other interesting project. Feel free to contact me to discuss potential collaborations!
