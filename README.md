quantitative analysis of large data sets to identify
trends, make predictions, and aid in decision-making.
- **Data Visualization**: Effective data visualization
is essential for making information accessible and
understandable.

### Programming Languages
- R
- Python
- Julia
- Nim
- JavaScript

## Coding Interests

- **Data Analysis**: I enjoy deriving insights from
complex data sets.
- **Data Visualization**: Translating statistical and
numerical information into graphs and diagrams to
enhance understanding.
- **Simulation**: Creating models to predict future
trends or test various hypotheses and strategies.
- **Web Scraping**: Efficiently extracting data from
websites to enrich my analyses.

I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate
on projects that explore these areas, or any other
interesting project. Feel free to contact me to
